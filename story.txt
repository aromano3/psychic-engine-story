There was a man named Brett. He went to college in Southern Northern Alabama. During his time there, he would black out frequently.
 Some say it's the Wisconsin him. Regardless, Brett is a normal guy like you and me. On his weekends he drinks beers with the boys and 
plays COD with his PS4 homies.

However people don't know that he is a superman who combats evils in the dark.

As superhero, he took his evil fighting duties very seriously, but o ne saturday night, when he was 9 beers deep, he got a call from is sidekick, who said that a theif was breaking into the Apple store, and stealing all of the iPhones and MacBooks.

He was very angry. He flew to the air, used his laser to scan the city. He recognized the theif. Brett caught him up and interrogated the theif. The theif said "It's none of your business!" Brett was very angry.

Then, Brett took it upon himself to outwit the thief and rob him. It was easy. He pulled out a handgun and shot him. The end.
