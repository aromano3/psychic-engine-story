There was a man named Brett. He went to college in Southern Northern Alabama. During his time there, he would black out frequently.
 Some say it's the Wisconsin him. Regardless, Brett is a normal guy like you and me. On his weekends he drinks beera with the boys and 
plays COD with his PS4 homies.

However people don't know that he is a superman who combats evils in the dark.

As superhero, he took his evil fighting duties very seriously.  But Brett, was also a bro, who would never say no to cracking open 
a cold one with the boys.  One saturday night, when he was 9 beers deep, he got a call from his sidekick, who said that a theif was
breaking into the Apple store, and stealing all of the iPhones and MacBooks.
