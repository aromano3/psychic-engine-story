There was a man named Brett. He went to college in Southern Northern Alabama. During his time there, he would black out frequently.
 Some say it's the Wisconsin him. Regardless, Brett is a normal guy like you and me. On his weekends he drinks beera with the boys and 
plays COD with his PS4 homies.

However people don't know that he is a superman who combats evils in the dark.
